  <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
  <p>Welcome! I use this web site to share thoughts on Internet technologies, their strengths and weaknesses, and try to
  find ways to improve them. I don't aim for tutorials or how-to tips as there is plenty of them on the Internet. I
  rather focus on the design and complexity managment (a.k.a. simplicity) on the development side.</p>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li><span class="date">{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
