<p>
Here is an overview of some Java libraries I have written and published under
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache2
license</a>. It means they are free to be used in other projects, feedback and
updates are more than welcome.

<h2 id="sqlstore">SqlStore</h2>

<p>
Calling SQL from Java code is some what old and ugly problem, which has been
tried to cure with Object-Relational mappings (frameworks) and other libraries,
which generate SQL code using query builders to enable compile-time query
correctness checking.
</p>

<p>
SqlStore belives in opposite approach where SQL statements should be executed as
they are, and that reading result-set values back to Java objects (the mapping)
does not have to part of Java code.
</p>

<p>
With SqlStore, SQL statements are stored outside of Java code in separate files
with one-to-one relationship with the class or interface where the SQL
statements are used. SqlStore provides an API for loading these SQL statements
at bootstrap phase, and enables invoking of these statements by name at runtime.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to hide execution of SQL statements behind a custom interface so
that calling its method actually triggers SqlStore script execution behind the
scenes.
</p>

<p>
SqlStore enables separation of SQL and Java code while also letting developers
write the SQL statements they actually want to execute. In addition, since the
SQL code is independent of application, it becomes easier to support different
database vendors as the application can be distributed with the script files of
the corresponding database.

<p>
<em>SqlStore</em> is a small Java library, has no external dependencies, and
is open-sourced under Apache2 license. You can read
<a href="/sqlstore/">more about it here</a>.

<h2 id="rocket-config">Rocket-Config</h2>

<p>
Many programs read their settings from a plain text file. Java, by default,
supports properties file, which is good but not perfect for most cases.
<em>Rocket-Config</em> prefers a common settings syntax from the UNIX world,
where the settings file is divided into sections and each section can have its
own custom format for specifying parameters.
<p>

<p>To read such configuration files, <em>Rocket-Config</em> provides an API for
describing sections and their content formats, and it takes an object where the
parsed values will be stored. Once the parser completes, application has an
object containing validated setting values to use through-out its components.

<em>Rocket-Config</em> is a small Java library, has no external dependencies,
and is open-sourced under Apache2 license. You can read

</p>

<h2 id="rocket-path">Rocket-Path</h2>

<p>
Tree is a very common data structure in computer science. It is very effective
in many use cases, such as file systems, or dividing large domains into smaller
sections. Hence, this library aims to provide a simple tree structure, several
ways to construct a tree, and a path object to simplify tree traversing.

<em>Rocket-Path</em> is a small Java library, has no external dependencies, and
is open-sourced under Apache2 license. You can read
