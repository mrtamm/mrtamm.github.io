For my first post I decided to choose a softer topic. Let's talk about the Internet. What is it? Most technical people
would associate it with a global network of computing devices. Non-technical people might associate it with some famous
Internet brand and web browsers. However, I'd like to focus on the Internet as a medium.

### The Old New

Over the history of mankind, people have exchaned information in quite various ways. Let's remember for a moment paintings
in caves, symbols carved in stone, pigeon mail, and the postal service of today. In all of these cases, information has
been stored and then somehow delivered to some recipients. The medium has been stone and paper with optional transport
mechanisms. Modern technologies also use radio waves (TV and radio)

The Internet is very similar. Information stored in computers is made accessible to people using various connections
between devices. Like with newspapers, people accessing information in a network must be aware of it (know its name and
address). Electronic mail mimics the letters sent using the regular postal service. Thanks to advanced capabilities of
devices, people can watch "TV" or listen to "radio" over the Internet. As a side note, advertisements are very often
used by services on the Internet to support their operations... just like in newspapers, TV, and radio. Coincidence?  

Technical people may think of, for example, newspapers as specially produced paper with ink printed on it, and then
delivered by postal workers to some people. However, for most people this view of newspaper makes no sense as they see
the newspaper content the key part that makes it valuable to us. The medium is always somewhat irrelevant, it's the
content -- the message or information -- that matters to us. The same applies to the Internet.

### The Unexpected New

The main reason, that the Internet has had such a dramatic effect on old mediums, is its richness of information sources
and better tools for interaction. Previously there were not so many sources of information to trust and the
subscribers did not have many choices for engaging in the communication to express additional views or even opose. They
could mostly unsubscribe or create a new source of information for their own kind of subscribers. In addition, let's
note that due to slow information exchange, each message was expected to be more reviewed before sending (messages for
corrections would have required extra time). (The message publisher was and still is responsible for the message and it's
consequences.)

With its freedom, the Internet has also brought some confusions. Firstly, the are too many information sources, including
conflicting ones, and it's even hard to verify their correctness, since they are mostly not controlled. Secondly, this
built-in interaction support has also been applied to attack subscribers of a source. It's not the information that's
vulnerable but the software on devices that has poorly implemented support for handling specially crafted "unexpected"
input. Thirdly, the Internet is global and therefore legislation of different countries has had hard times to cope with
the shift.

### The Milestone

So  the Internet is a new medium supported by computing technology networks. It has its pros and cons. But is worth it?
After all, information stored as invisible-to-eye bits is quite vulnerable. However, I believe the Internet accelerates
critically the pace of global thinking. In addition, it helps to smooth cultural differences and make more people aware
of different ways for interpreting the world we share. Books are not gone, yet, and I believe that to some degree they
will always remain. Just that not all information needs to be printed. It depends on its quality, and how fast it renews
itself.

### Conclusion

It serves us well to think about the Internet as a medium for global thinking powered by connected computing devices.
This new medium has its strengths and weaknesses but it should not be treated inferior (as many more traditional people
might do) to old mediums such as books. It's just a medium. However, just like other mediums, the Internet also comes as
a playground with its own rules. First is that it's hard or even impossible to be controlled regarding the information
made public. Secondly, the Internet enables better interaction and co-working. And thirdly, considering the previous,
the Internet also be used to attack devices, information, and people in various ways, therefore they are vulnerable.
However, considering the advantages provided by the Internet, it's unlikely that people would drop it without a better
alternative.

*In this blog I would like to further on concentrate on various small topics regarding how Internet works. Most of them
will be technical, but sometimes I will also switch to metaphysics (like in this post) in order to keep world balanced.*
