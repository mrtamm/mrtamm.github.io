<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I use this web site to share thoughts on Internet technologies and developing
applications. I would like to explain concepts that are perhaps less known in
the mainstream development community, and also share thoughts on how to design
and build complex systems. After all, even web pages, that look simple and
friendly, rely on mixture of technologies enabled by browsers. In addition,
many different tools are used for composing these pages.
</p>

<p>
On programming topics, I mostly concentrate on Java, which I'm using the most.
However, I try to avoid Java-specific details, so that the concepts could be
incorporated in other programming languages as well.
</p>

<p>
I also share some of the Java libraries I have developped and hope they could be
useful to others as well. These are mostly small APIs that aim to boost
productivity in certain cases.
